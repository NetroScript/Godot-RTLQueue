RTLQueue - Demo
================================
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This is a very basic Demo for the functionality of the RTLQueue Plugin of the [Main Branch](https://github.com/NetroScript/Godot-RTLQueue).  
Godot >=3.1 is needed.  

The included "Ubuntu" fonts are not created/owned by me, you can find the license [here](https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/font-licence) or in the `Font LICENCE.txt`.

The code for this example script is attached to the panel as a script.

To try out just download this repository and open it as project in Godot.
